– Lao Tzu

> As a culture, we have a tendency to celebrate status that emerges from net worth and network signaling rather than the work ethic of a second-act founder using his net worth and network, while he grinds on a project, to drive the world forward. This is totally backwards.
– Trae Stephens

— Edward Kolb 

> We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us. 
— John M. Culkin

> Every man is an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others; he must live for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others not sacrificing others to himself; he must work for his *rational* self-interest, with the achievement of his own happiness as the highest moral purpose of his life. 
— Ayn Rand

> *Rationality* is man's basic virtue, and his three fundamental values are: reason, purpose, self-esteem. 
— Ayn Rand

> Reason is man's only proper judge of values and his only proper guide to action.
— Ayn Rand

> Oops is the sound we make when we improve. 
— Eliezer Yudkowsky

> The important question is not “Will I lose my job?” but “What can I do with superabundant intelligence?” 
– Packy McCormick

> You might be concerned that there’s really no point in starting a startup, learning how to code, or doing … anything anymore. Don’t quit just yet. When we have intelligence “too cheap to meter,” history suggests that we’ll find ways to put it all to work, with latent demand left to spare.
– Packy McCormick

> If you say no to a thing, then you’re saying no to one thing. If you say yes to a thing, you actually say no to every other thing during that period of time.

> Be yourself, but play with your character attributes. You can choose to be someone who’s a little good at a lot of things, or unbelievably good at one thing. Both work, and you can evolve your character over time. Play with the fearlessness of someone playing a game, because you are. These are internet strangers. At worst, they’ll ignore you, and you can keep workshopping and start over; at best, they’ll open up new doors. 
– Patty McCormick

> The Game rewards community and cooperation over individualism and competition. You get points for being curious, sharing, and helping with no expectation of reciprocation.

> Everything matters. Because everything is art. Everything is art. A kind gesture. A passionate kiss. A beautiful smile. All this is art and it goes way beyond writing, painting, and music. We only suffer if we don’t create.
– Nik Göke 

> You’re an artist. As such, everything you do is productive. Everything you do is productive. There is no “this is useful” and “this is a waste of time.” There is only your life. Every word you write, every picture you paint, every song you sing is a result of everything that’s in it. It all matters. Everything matters.
– Nik Göke

Accessible to 1.2bn humans. How can we possibly begin to imagine what kind of impact that might have?...
– Azeem Azhar 

> What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.
– Carl Sagan

> I’m a person who’s only satisfied if I feel I’m being productive. I like figuring things out. I like making things. And I want to do as much of that as I can.
– Stephen Wolfram

> If you’re dissatisfied with your current life, ask yourself what your current life is a metaphor for. That metaphor will point you toward your true calling.
– Steven Pressfield

> Ambition, I have come to believe, is the most primal and sacred fundament of our being. To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our soul. Not to act upon that ambition is to turn our back on ourselves and on the reason for our existence.
– Steven Pressfield

> Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account. 
– John W. Gardner

> We have to believe in ourselves, but we mustn’t suppose that the path will be easy, it’s tough. Life is painful, and rain falls on the just. 
– John W. Gardner

> For renewal, a tough-minded optimism is best. The future is not shaped by people who don’t really believe in the future. Men and women of vitality have always been prepared to bet their futures, even their lives, on ventures of unknown outcome. If they had all looked before they leaped, we would still be crouched in caves sketching animal pictures on the wall. 
– John W. Gardner


> There are men and women who make the world better just by being the kind of people they are.
– John W. Gardner

> You have to build meaning into your life, and you build it through your commitments — whether to your religion, to an ethical order as you conceive it, to your life’s work, to loved ones, to your fellow humans. Young people run around searching for identity, but it isn’t handed out free any more — not in this transient, rootless, pluralistic society. Your identity is what you’ve committed yourself to.
– John W. Gardner

> You never get the impression that a cow is about to have a nervous breakdown. Or is puzzling about the meaning of life.
– John W. Gardner

> There is no perfection of techniques that will substitute for the lift of spirit and heightened performance that comes from strong motivation, The world is moved by highly motivated people, by enthusiasts, by men and women who want something very much or believe very much.
– John W. Gardner

> But life isn’t a mountain that has a summit, Nor is it — as some suppose — a riddle that has an answer. Nor a game that has a final score. Life is an endless unfolding, and if we wish it to be, an endless process of self-discovery, an endless and unpredictable dialogue between our own potentialities and the life situations in which we find ourselves.
– John W. Gardner

> Learn all your life. Learn from your failures. Learn from your successes, When you hit a spell of trouble, ask “What is it trying to teach me?”
– John W. Gardner

> Our parents and the society at large have a hand in building our prisons.
– John W. Gardner

> Life is the art of drawing without an eraser.
– John W. Gardner

> Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.
– Shane Parrish
