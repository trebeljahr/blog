<p>{excerpt}</p>

After reading this, you should be able to understand the code that makes a neural network *work*.

To understand a Neural Network, we first have to look at a single neuron. Even though they share the same name, they don't have much in common with *actual* biological neurons. In machine learning and neural networks, a "neuron" is nothing but a very simple function. It has a number of inputs, and computes an output from them, by applying some mathematical operation. Like an addition, or a multiplication. 

Let's look at a neuron in action.
