Major depressive episodes are hard. Bipolar Disorder is bad 

Stoicism. Mental toughness training.

Simplicity: 
> We suffer more often in imagination than in reality. 
â€“ Lucius Seneca

Meditation on the bad things that could happen as a written exercise: 

1. Page: what if I ...? 
- Define. 10-20 of the worst things you could think of happening. 
- Prevent: think of 3-4 strategies for each, on how you could prevent it. 
- Repair: What can you do to decrease the damage. Has anyone ever solved this before you?
2. Page: What's the upside? What's the benefits?
3. Page: Cost of Inaction? If I avoid it? What will my life look like in 1 month? 3 months? 6 months? 1 year? 3 year? 

Jerzy Gregorek: Stoicism. No life more beautiful than the life of a stoic. 

Whole Quote [#TODO].

[#TODO] Printout, do exercise.
