**Closing a Year - Change for Next Year:**

3 keys to Success
1. Enthusiasm in everything you do. 
2. Connecting people. And with people. 
3. Expect magic in every encounter. 

Internal Dialogue? Live it. Lean into every moment expecting magic. 

Relationships - switch where am I supposed to be against, who do I know, what is the quality of my relationships? Maintain and build relationships. 

> Getting good at Leadership is hard. 

What makes a good leader? 
- know when and when not to speak. 
- let people learn themselves, while protecting them from disaster
- vision for where you want to go
- let people resolve their conflicts on their own

**Lesson:** 
Be focused on the most important question. Know where to focus, don't focus more, but where it's important. 

How to keep question present?
Write in the morning. Digest over night. Jot down observations. Sleep on it, consciously integrate in the morning. 

Stop practicing and working before sleep, to release consciousness from a problem. 

**Morning Routine:**
- Workout
- Meditate -> [Heart Rate Variability Training](#TODO)

It doesn't make sense is a pointer to wrong models. It's something to pay extreme attention to. Ask why.

Examine Obvious Things. Thinking about systems and discover what to do. 

Hard problems are hard because their solutions are unexpected. Invert what you would do to solve easy problems. Don't trust your instincts as much. Or even actively decide the opposite of them. 

Saying opinions in the public, while also being able to change them continuously is hard. 

Question: What would you need to change your opinion?

Metals traders predict currency changes quite accurately. 

Worry about big things, and fix those. 
Hire great people, fire fast. Listen to this. Don't forget the basics. Get them right. Life works good if focused on the big things. Letting small things slip is fine. 

Click War. Don't write back angry. Be compassionate, and respond in a way that changes the tone of the conversation. Handle the haters well. Have a bad hair day? Interesting, please tell me more?

Dirty players, smile, practice with them. Keep playing by the rules, but train how to deal with people who don't. Don't build a cult on your inhibitions.

Don't calcify learning processes. When doing speaking talks and being public, that is putting the focus away from learning. Talk only as Q and A. 

Look outside your field. 
No one book. Books gifted are specific to a single person.

Advice of Happiest Version of Your 80 year old self: 
- Listen to advice. But if it doesn't feel right, skip it and come back later. Maybe a year, five years.

— Wonba Mate - Flying Matador [#TODO]

Hold standards. 
Excellence is self expression. 

> As we are discovering ourselves we are creating ourselves. 
– Josh Waitzkin 

Self and doing things are entangled. Navigating the entanglement is part of the growth of self. Listening to who the self is and what it becomes through our actions is important. 

Leave at the peak. Don't go ticking the boxes for the boxes sake. 

Fix at ball bearings, things that other people are not interested. Reinvent things that we are taking for a given. Think about things that nobody thinks about.
