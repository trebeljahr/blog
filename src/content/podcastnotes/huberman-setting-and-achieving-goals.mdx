## Summary 

<p>{excerpt}</p>


## Summary: 

- Moderately challenging goals
- Concrete Actions
- Visualize failure instead of success
- Use Visual Focus to gain attention increases 
- Use own reward schedule for dopamine

Only 1 circuit for goal setting in brain. 

## Error Rate

Errors help Neuroplasticity. What rate should errors occur? How hard should tasks be for optimal learning? 

**Paper:** [The 85% rule for optimal learning](#TODO)

About 85% success rate. About 15% failure. Is optimal for learning. After errors brain is in an optimal position to learn. 

Keep reaching. Reminds me of [Flow](/booknotes/flow) - not too difficult, not too easy. Just right is optimal for flow + learning. 

## Neural Circuits

System for goal setting is conserved between many animals, including humans. We have ability to set and pursue long term goals. Human brains can also hold multiple goals at the same time in our brain, interacting with each other. 

Goal Setting and Pursuing has to be juggled. 

Neural Circuit - collection of brain areas active in sequence. Together - a specific behavior, a specific state, a specific experience. 

Goals involve neural circuits. 

[Amygdala](#TODO) - sense of fear and anxiety. 

[Ventral Striatum](#TODO) - part of basal ganglia. 

[Basal Ganglia](#TODO) - go-no-go pathways. Action and Inaction. Behavior control. 

[Cortex](#TODO) 

[Lateral Prefrontal Cortex](#TODO) - high level planning, and thinking about how to get somewhere. 

[Orbitofrontal Cortex](#TODO) - project emotional state into future to determine whether or not action would be good. How would we feel if we were to do X? 

No matter the goal - all of these are involved. 

These circuits evaluate goals and make us act or not act based on that value of the goal. Value information is most important. 

Dopamine is currency of goal progress. 

## Goal Setting and Pursuit

Following through on goals will be easier if value of action is clear. 

Goal Setting Literature has lots of acronyms. Redundancy. 

ABC - achievable, believable, committed. 
SMART - specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, time-bound. 
SMARTER - e - ethical, r - rewarding. 

Any goal pursuit has to involve neural circuits from above. 

-> Setting, Assessment, Execution. 

**2 Broad phases:**
1. Assessing Value
2. Executing Behavior

What would you like to accomplish?

## Inside vs. Outside of Immediate Reach 

- peri-personal space:  Interoception, understanding of body. Things very nearby, that you can reach for and consume. Immediately. 

- extero-personal space: everything away, far enough so that we have to "get up and move there to get it". Away in space and or time. 

Evaluation is happening in peri-personal space. 

We can shift things towards extra personal space. 

## Things that people get wrong

- Multitasking is not necessarily bad. Multitasking has to happen at a particular time. Increase in levels of neuromodulator [epinephrine](#TODO). Before important task, it's increasing propensity for action. Only before focused work, to start focused work. Then contract focus. Specifically visual focus, which is linked to cognitive focus. Looking at small point increases mental focus. 

Paper: [Emily Belzetis](#TODO)

Looking at the Goal line, helps to do things with less effort, and faster. Reason: Autonomic Nervous System. Visual Information when focused on single point is handled differently. Virgins Eye movement. 

[Magno Cellar Pathway](#TODO)- relaxed state on the other hand. 

Arousal goes up with visual focus. Visual system changed blood flow. Specifically blood pressure changes. Systolic + diastolic. Contraction + Expansion. Lower vs. higher value. 120/80. Visual System is linked to systolic blood pressure. It goes up when focused, visually. Also releases adrenaline. Thinking about goal is not enough. Physical pursuit is necessary. Visual system links the two. See, then act. 

Mental Frame is either focused onto peri personal or external space. 

**Paper:** [Keeping the Goal in Sight - Testing the Influence of Narrowed Visual Attention on Physical Activity](#TODO)

Focus visual attention on something outside of body. Hold it for 30-60 seconds. Increases mental focus. 

Even effective in ADHD patients. 

## Long Term Goals

Immediate reward and craving, focus is instantly there. Reward system is tied to short term time frames. Delayed discounting - goal far in the future = less motivation to act on it. 

2 Groups in Study:
1. Imagining what it is like to be in the future. 
2. Viewing aged images of themselves. 

2nd more directed to invest in future. Seeing what the future would look like, helps to have goal directed behavior. 

> What we see is principally important in defining what we do in the immediate term, even if what we see is something far off in the distance. 

## Visualizing Failure

Does visualization work? It depends. 

Visualizing the big goal is effective for getting started, but not for maintaining pursuit. Blood pressure increases, excitement increases. The body adapts to that visualization over time. Maybe even counterproductive in the long time. 

**Better way:** Visualizing failure instead of success. Focus on failure. Near doubling on success rate. This, in a way, is the stoic method. 

> Foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way to motivate toward goal pursuit. 

Think about how bad it's going to be if you fail. Amygdala kicks in and hijacks goal pursuit setting behavior. 

Specific failure points. We are better in being motivated from bad things. 

## Size of Goals

3 Categories of Goals:
Easy, Possible, Impossible. Too easy goals don't work. Motivation will not kick in. Systolic blood pressure doesn't rise, hence no action happens. The same is true about impossible goals. There is a sweet spot of moderate possible goals. Maybe in range is important. Doubling or more of likelyhood again.

Set goals that are challenging, yet have a real chance at success. Not too easy, not too hard. 

## How many goals?

Only 1 at a time. Maybe 2-4 per year, because that's what most people can reasonably achieve. 

Too many options lead to attention drift. Eliminate everything that's not necessary. Visual sparceness helps focus. 

Minimalism is effective for goal directed behavior. Both in environment and things to pursue. 

## Specificity of Goals 

**Paper:** [Recycling Study](#TODO)

Concrete and specific plan helps achieve goals. Exact measure and concrete action steps are important. Plan is essential. Again doubling of likelyhood. Assess weekly, re-adjust action plans. 

## The Role of Dopamine

Even without dopamine rats will enjoy pleasure. But achieving it won't happen. It will not move. Same is true for humans. 

Dopamine is at the heart of the pursuit of pleasure. And also goals. 

> Dopamine is the common currency by which we pursue goals. 

Dopamine follows Reward Prediction Error. If things happen that are novel and beneficial, dopamine spikes the highest. 

Anticipation of reward is the key. Unexpected positive events release a lot of dopamine. 

But anticipation also releases dopamine. When actual experience happens, a little dopamine is released. 

If expected thing doesn't happen, dopamine drops, and we feel disappointed. The difference between Anticipation and Reality is the key to utilize dopamine.

Milestone placing? How far in the future? 

Physiological Effects of actions like running, depend on voluntarily producing the action. Being forced to do an action is bad for the outcome. It's stressful. We need to keep in mind why we *want* to do something and that it's our *choice* to do so.

From this follows: Any reward schedule is good as long as we choose it to be good for us. Pick an interval, assess progress in that interval. Regularly. Consistently. Reward is purely mental. Like mentally patting yourself on the back. 

Our idea of "things are going good" influences dopamine. If we think the going is good, that has a self-reinforcing effect, and if we reward that, it helps motivation. Every week, think: "Yay, another week *done*". Checkmarks somewhere help.  

Self amplifying system of dopamine when striving towards goals. Dopamine systems don't crash, as long as no pharmacology is added to the mix. 

Dopamine and Visual Systems interact with each other. 

**Paper:** [Wolfram Scholz](#TODO)

Focusing on particular point in vision help pursuing things in extra personal space. Dopamine increase from focus. But also focus increase from dopamine. Visual system is linked with dopamine system. 

L-Tyrosine and Caffeine. But before that behavior tools. Because they utilize neuroplasticity. These tools get better over time, unlike chemicals. They are temporary and don't help on their own. 

**The Tool Chain**
Behavior > Nutrition > Supplements > Medication

## Tool - Space Time Bridging

Shift attention to extra personal space. 
Space Time Bridging. Step focus from peri personal to extra personal space and back. To gain control over this neurocircuitry. 

1. Close Eyes and focus on inner landscape for 3 slow breaths. 
2. Open eyes. Focus on area on surface of body. Say palm of hand. 10% attention there. 3 slow breaths again. Again focusing 90% on internal state. 
3. View object a little away. 90% attention on that object. Again 3 breaths. 10% for that. 
4. Now object very far away, ideally on horizon. 99%. As much as possible. Again 3 breaths.
5. Dilate visual field. Use peripheral vision. 3 Breaths. 
6. Repeat. 

Visual system slices up time as well as space. Internal state is experienced as more slowly. Frame rate is slower. Useful for goals. Most goals are long term, off in the future. Time in between is carved into steps and milestones. 

Intermittent and random is the best reward schedule we know. 

Being able to tend to different slices of time and space is just like setting goals. Visual system trick helps train the neurocircuitry to help map to different time frames. And adhere to schedules.
