## Summary

## Detailed Notes

## Foreword

Back in Athens philosophy was a common good. 

> Not what we have but what we enjoy constitutes our abundance. 

> Nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little. 

Buddhism had an influence on Epicurus because his teachers went to India. 

The main idea is Ataraxia. The freedom from metal anguish and disturbance.

**Book Recommendation:** The Nature of Things - Lucretius

The absence of pain is pleasure. However, opium is still not good, because it has in it the seed for a lot of pain, because you get addicted to it. 

There is a hedonic treadmill. Epicurus is about being here, *now*. Epicurus main question: How to live the best life possible?

## Introduction 

## Chapter 1. Development of the Atomic Concept

Materialism - the idea that all reality can be reduced to matter or matter in motion (and energy and fields, basically physics). 

> You can't step into the same river twice
— Heraclitus

The idea that everything is derived from flux, everything is in motion all the time. Things try to get into order, only to be opposed by entropy. 

Parmenides has the opposite view. Nothingness can't exist, because it's impossible to conceive. Something exists. It always will. It's not on flux, but unchanging. This block of everything is bounded, immovable, though not divisible.

This bounded sphere if shrunk, is the same as an atom, hence the theories of Parmenides and Heraclitus can be reconciled into Atomism. 

Greek philosophy was only the first step in the scientific method. The creation of theories, but not their testing or mathematical expression. 

## Chapter 2 - First Principle's of Atomism and their Implications

Understanding the world is a cure against religion. No fear from gods is necessary for happiness. 

Nothing stays nothing, and something stays something. In other words, the conservation of energy and mass. Things are made of smaller things, eventually atoms. Atoms exist in space. 
Everything arises from this interplay, of atoms and space. 

## Chapter 3 - The Motion of Atoms 

Motion is eternal (momentum is conserved). 

Atoms can move at different speeds, even if the object they make up travels along a specific trajectory. One object can move faster in a direction, even though it's atoms move less fast in that direction. Say, because one object is hot, while the other is cold. 

If we are completely determined by physics, then there is no free will. 

## Chapter 4 - Sensation an Perception

Sensation comes from the physical arrangement of atoms. When that arrangement changes too much, sensation ceases. We die. 

But therefore to us, death is not scary. It's just not being there. 

Films of atoms emanate from other atoms and reach us, interacting with out atoms, to produce sensations. This is basically how photons and other particles work. 

The senses don't deceive us, they just report the "raw" data of what's out there. But our interpretation imposed on the sensory data does. Nowadays we do know, that senses regularly fail in all kinds of weird and interesting ways. 

**Thought:** The soul is "immaterial" because it's in the pattern of the neurons. It's the same property that causes consciousness and awareness and memories, deeply integrated information processing of information processing within the brain. 2nd or even 3rd level integration of information and in that sense it's really immaterial. Hosted in and by matter, but not really part of it. It's like the origami which is more than a piece of paper. The structure and organization of matter, the pattern of information it encodes, that's it's soul. 

Perceptions are films of atoms colliding with our senses. This is quite prescient. Senses can't deceive us, only our interpretation of the data can deceive us. But that interpretation happens so soon and immediately that what we call our senses is already processed and opinionated in modern neuroscience terms at least. 

Knowledge becomes impossible to acquire if all sensory data is doubted. Skepticism leads to not knowing anything at all. 

Feelings are a guide to the good life. Doubting sense is doubting feelings and therefore Epicurus didn't like skepticism. 

## Chapter 5  - Theory of Knowledge

> The happy and the good life presupposes knowing and knowing how to. 

Theory of Knowledge is hence axiomatic and dogmatic, these two are not questioned. 

Ataraxia - freedom from irrational fears and anxieties - is the purpose of knowledge. 

Reasoning builds from sensations, if those are wrong the reasoning is wrong too. 

States of pleasure are good, states of pain are bad. Actions derive their moral value from wether they lead to more pain or more pleasure overall. 

**Book Recommendation:** Essay Concerning Human Understanding - John Locke

Concepts we can name with words are evidence for truth. Being able to manipulate concepts by language is a form of knowing. It's aggregating sensory data into a fixed form. 

They thought that things are true if they can't be disproven by data. This makes no sense, because an infinity of things about the same context would be true. But still it's the main idea behind falsification. Many theories could be true, unless proven otherwise by evidence. 

### Chapter 6 - Religion and Theology

Ataraxia the state of peace of mind is am imitation of the gods. The gods are perfectly happy, all the time calmly contemplating their own perfection. Having ataraxia is attaining godlike mental status. It is to be enlightened. Or to be the stoic Sage. Or the master of the Tao. 

Gods ar perfect, hence they don't need or want adoration from humans. They don't even listen, because they are busy being blissful. 

> True religion is rather the power to contemplate nature with a mind set at peace. 
– Lucretius

The world is a-teological it's without purpose in itself. 

> Nature is not a cosmic mind; it is a non intelligent system of atoms that incidentally and accidentally produced minds. 

On how this happens, read [From Bacteria to Bach and Back by Daniel Dennett](/booknotes/bacteria-to-bach-and-back). 

Religion is a danger to ataraxia because somebody who is anxious because of gods doesn't have peace of mind and bliss. It's an irrational fear, that makes religions harmful and ethically bad. 

### Chapter 6 - Ethics and the Good Life

Things are moral if over our whole lifetime they produce more pleasure than pain. Knowing about how the world works is therefore necessary to predict consequences of our behaviour and decide what's moral and what isn't. Since nobody has perfect foresight, most things can't be decided in the moment whether or not they are morally good or bad. 

Pleasure is the absence of pain. It's not sensual enjoyment. It's rather ascetic, having a life that doesn't allow for pain to occur. 

Epicurus was trying to become enlightened, just like the Buddha. 

Avoiding pain means not taking risks. It's not focusing on what could be had in life, but at what could be avoided. Living the good life in a way is living a life that is utterly boring, because it's without tension, without trying to grasp for something more, without risking failure, because failure could mean pain, and pain is to be avoided. 

> Withdraw from the world; avoid the pains and dangers of involvement; seek your own security and serenity. 

> What acts of mine are likely to bring pain or pleasure to *others*? Do I have a duty to increase the happiness of others as well as my own happiness? Can I be happy myself if I ignore the unhappiness of others around me?

Freedom of will comes from random "swerves" of atoms. Uncaused atomic fluctuations result in free will. Without the exact details this position is not holdable, even if Heisenberg's uncertainty principle and quantum mechanics in general show that these random motions exist, we still haven't connected them all the way up to results in human actions. 

Epicureanism is not flat hedonism. It's more sophisticated, more drawn away from life and ascetic. Because the hedonistic pleasures have long term pains associated with them which the Epicurean tries to avoid. 

## Excerpts from the Life of Epicurus

Reason is worth less than sensations. It depends on sensations. Sensations are worth the same. Sensations are without memory. Things we see are *actually* true. Things we don't perceive are still deduced from what we perceive. Ideas are sensations, combined with reasoning in various ways to produce insights. 

We perceive things as distinct things that we can name. Still before the name has to come the sensation. 

> Concepts are clear and distinct evidences of truth. 

Feelings are universal to animals and humans. There are only 2 - pleasure and pain, and from them we decide what we avoid and what we seek out. 

> Men inflict injuries from hatred, jealousy, or contempt, but the wise man masters all the passions by means of reason. 

Mental pains are worse, because they affect past, present and future whereas bodily pains pass along and are forgotten eventually. 

## Letter to Herodotus 

Souls are made up of particles. If the particles are scattered and their structure is lost, the soul disappears. When we die, the particles scatter, and even though the same particles still exist, the soul will be gone. The soul is perceiving the world around it, through the senses and the body. When the particles that make up the soul don't move in the right ways anymore, the quality of the soul disappears. 

**Thought:** Replacing mind or consciousness into the word soul, would make the above read almost like neuroscience. 

Epicurus thought that there were multiple worlds. Reading this, he almost sounds like a time traveler. A lot of what he said, back then, is still very very accurate even today, and even though some details are wrong, the broad picture he paints is according to what we know now by modern science. 

> Management of business affairs, worries, feelings of anger, and good will do not harmonize with the state of blessedness but are found where there is lack of strength and where we fear and have need of those around us. 

> The minds of men are best by awe because they see much taking place on earth and in the heavens. 

## Letter to Pythocles

In the absence of good scientific tools and data, any theory goes, and they had lots of crazy theories and ideas about how all kinds of things might have worked. Some surprisingly close to the actual explanations, others absolutely trash from a modern point of view. 

## Letter to Menoeceus

> No one should postpone the study of philosophy when he is young, nor should he weary of it when he becomes mature, because the search for mental health is never untimely or out of season. 

Death is meaningless, because only sensations have meaning, and death ends all sensations. 

Pleasure is the absence of pain, going beyond that like in sex and luxurious goods or extremely tasty foods is nonsensical since it only ope s one up to the possibility of pain in the future. Being content with the things that one absolutely needs for surviving is the recipe for happiness. 

Sex is something that makes more trouble than what it's worth and furthermore is an unquenchable thirst. The pleasure derived from it is only temporary and the pain it causes is worse, so overall it's not Epicurean to indulge in the lusts of the flesh. 

## Leading Doctrines

The limit for pleasure is absence of pain. 

Security and safety from pain are good things. Everything that doesn't secure that is by extension also not good.

Living pleasantly is tied to living justly, sensibly and nobly and vice versa. They are intertwined and deeply connected. 

Science is a tool to be more happy with the world. Because it removes fears by giving us knowledge about how they work. This way we gain control about them and can better avoid pain and thereby live pleasantly. 

Being safe from the universe and other people in it is a goal of epicureanism. 

> Nature's wealth is restricted and easily won, while that of empty convention runs on to infinity. 

Infinite time doesn't help, because pleasure has a limit given by our bodies. 

**Thought:** What would Epicurus think about this if he knew about neuroscience and thought about being able to change human bodies and their nature so that different sorts of pleasures would be possible?

> There is no need for enterprises that entail the struggle for success. 

Only things that lead to physical pain are to be avoided. The rest can be accepted and shifted by a different frame of mind. 

Justice is the agreement between people to not harm each other. 

## The Vatican Collection of Aphorisms

> Poverty when measured by the goals that nature has set, is great wealth, whereas unlimited wealth is great poverty.
