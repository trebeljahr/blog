excerpt: "The main idea of this book is that Rational Egoism is virtuous and necessary. We need to take accountability of our own future. When doing so, we improve the future for everybody. Out of egoism flows altruism. But the book packages and weaves this idea into a gripping story, where good and bad fight it out, and the egoistic people simply leave, letting society collapse and die. Hence the name of the book, Atlas Shrugged."

## Summary

<p>{excerpt}</p>

The main plot of the story revolves around a woman named Dagny Taggarty, who is running a railroad business. Because of her struggles the railroad keeps moving every day and on time, but she is on the point of breaking. Things are not going well.

There is tension. Cost-cutting and regulations creep in, which make the business harder to run each day. People pile up more and more constraints, but expect the same output from the railroad. The workload and requirements increase, but the people who expect results, don't want to do any work themselves. They want to use people like Dagny, to do their work for them, slowly binding and milking them for their own benefits, while relaxing themselves and gaining profits from the work of others.

In that process the book deals with the question of "Who is John Galt?" over and over again. In the book, this is a saying that expresses, "who cares?", thrown around when quality is lacking. 

The answer to that question should be – us. We should be the ones who care. We should care to build quality. And be self-motivated and do our work. Not for the sake of others, but for the sheer happiness derived from the work and the products of the work. Building better machinery, uncovering the laws of the universe, and creation of beauty is rewarding. Doing science, engineering, writing, music and other things, helps to keep the world running. They are things we don't do for the sake of others, but for our own. The joy of creation, is what drives this work. 

Because we want these things to exist in the real world, we go out and make them exist. We work very hard, to make them exist. That in a way is Ayn Rand's definition of virtue.When we are striving for our own good, to make our creations come true, that's when humans are virtuous. And in the process people improve the common good as well. Creation is making the pie bigger. It's not about dividing the pie, because that's a zero sum game. [A finite game](/booknotes/finite-and-infinite-games), not worth playing.

She contrasts it with another approach to life. That of controlling people and living of other people's work. Essentially figuring out ways to coerce and force people into doing your bidding. In a way, finding ways of dividing the pie instead of making it bigger. Always relying on others to actually create the pie, and then grabbing the biggest share of the pie, whenever possible.

Those are people, who for the sake of altruism, treat others, so that they don't have to take on responsibility for their own futures. To each according to their ability to each according to their needs, is their creed. 

This ends up in a mess, and it's that mess that Atlas Shrugged shows in the form of a novel. When the people who work the hardest, gain nothing of their achievements, they might still work, because they love their work and creation so much. But it's fundamentally unfair to them. And if they, if only for a moment, "shrug" and stop working, the whole edifice of society comes crumbling down and desintegrates under it's own weight. Because if the people who work, had enough and stop, there wouldn't be anything anymore. And society would die.

The results of working and moving things, making things happen and materialize in the real world, is necessary for life. People who do this kind of work are what Ayn Rand calls "Prime Movers". They are the people who go out and make things happen. They are the people, who created the entire world as we know it today and who push progress. They are the John Galt's of this world. 

In a way Ayn Rand tries to convince the readers to become Prime Movers themselves. Everybody, should be John Galt. Since the question to "who cares", should be, "us". We should care about quality and our own futures. We should be egoistic about it.

## Detailed Notes

## Part One - Non-Contradiction

### Chapter 1 - Theme

> He still thought it self-evident that one had to do what was right; he had never learned how people could want to do otherwise; he had only learned that they did. It still seemed simple and incomprehensible to him; simple that things should be right, and incomprehensible that they weren't. 

> I know I know, he's making money. But that is not the standard, it seems to me, by which one gauges a man's value in society. 

> She noticed that she did have time to feel something, it was the hard, exhilarating pleasure of action. 

> He liked to observe emotions; they were like red lanterns String along the dark unknown of another's personality, marking vulnerable points. 

> I'm not in the business of giving chances. I'm running a railroad. 

> He shrugged and smiled—he was alive for a moment and it was the strangest smile she had  ever seen: it held secret amusement, and heartbreak, and an infinite bitterness. He answered: "Who is John Galt?"

How the world slowly turns towards disarray, with nobody caring about it, nobody understanding what is happening and everybody just shrugging it off with, it's not my responsibility so why bother. And then the few people who do care, who believe in their own power to change things, and who don't ever understand why the world is just such a bad place and why everybody dispairs, why almost nobody has competence and keeps the world running. And also how those people flock to each other, and how they build great things, together, out of necessity, because that's the only expression of their wills, their lives. 

### Chapter 2 - The Chain 

> After a while he went back to his task; he decided that pain was not a valid reason for stopping. 

> He had never been able to understand why men should be unhappy. 

> If it meant affection, then he was unjust to experience a heavy, murky feeling which kept him silent lest his voice betray that the feeling was disgust. 

> The claim seemed to have the form of affection, but it was a form which he found harder to endure than any sort of hatred. He despised causeless affection, just as he despised unearned wealth. 

> It was almost... Almost as if they were wounded by the mere fact of his being. 

How people can not understand other people, and the feeling of being helplessly tied to them, even though one didn't do the tying, even though one doesn't care, but just wants to be good, just wants to do ones thing. 

And then is still disappointing everybody, being greeted with spite, even though ones best intentions, everything being twisted around, to attack, even though one never wanted to fight and if one were to fight back, one would destroy them all. And them knowing that, and attacking because they have a perverse understanding of the situation, they know they couldn't win an outright fight, yet since the other party doesn't want to fight, they can keep stabbing, little cuts. 

#### Chapter 3 - The Top and the Bottom

> When people are unanimous, how does one man dare to dissent? By what right? That's what I want to know—by what right?

This is at the heart of the whole book, the justified belief, the conviction into one's own abilities. Into the ability to learn, and to improve and the real confidence that comes with it. We will fail, over and over again in the short run, but in the long run, that doesn't matter, because we're going to succeed. That spirit of transcendence, is what powers people like Elon Musk, and it's what keeps the world going forward. How come that we live in the caricature, that Ayn Rand painted nowadays? 

The group talking on this chapter displays double speak at its finest. Warping reality in every which way, saying they don't like certain forms of behavior in one instance and then condemning the opposite behavior that they just praised themselves for a second ago, when they are on the other side. They are truly selfish, but hide it behind good talk of philosophy and politics. 

> People who are afraid to sacrifice somebody have no business taking about a common purpose. 

The people who want to sacrifice others for "the greater good" tend to also be the ones who benefit disproportionately from this "greater good". Sacrificing other for your own gain, is truly evil. Hiding it behind a narrative of "public gain" is even worse. And much more dangerous. Because it's so effective. 

> She felt the same emotion in school, in classes of mathematics, the only lessons she liked. She felt the excitement of solving problems, the insolent delight of taking up a challenge and disposing of it without effort, the eagerness to meet another, harder test. 

> The adversary she found herself forced to fight was not worth matching or beating; it was not a superior ability which she would have found honor in challenging; it was ineptitude—a gray spread of cotton that seemed soft and shapeless, that could offer no resistance to anything or anybody, yet managed to be a barrier in her way. 

> Material greed isn't everything. There are non-material ideals to consider. 

> His face showed the anger of failure—because hers showed nothing. 

> She resented the small defeat of being tired, but she knew that she was tonight. 

> Nathaniel Taggart had been a penniless adventurer, who had come from somewhere in New England and built a railroad across a continent, in the days of the first steel rails. His railroad still stood; his battle to build it had dissolved into a legend, because people preferred not to understand it or to believe it possible. He was a man who had never accepted the creed that other had the right to stop him. He set his goal and moved toward it, his way as straight as one of his rails. He never sought any loans, bonds, subsidies, land grants or legislative favors from the government. He obtained money from the men who owned it, going from door to door—from the mahogany doors of bankers to the clapboard doors of lonely farmhouses. He never talked about the public good. He merely told the people that they would make big profits on his railroad, he told them why he expected the profits and he gave his reasons. He had good reasons. 

> All that Dagny wanted of life was contained in  the desire to hold her head as he did. 

> "I don't like the thing that's happening to people Miss Taggart." "What?" "I don't know. But I've watched them here for twenty years and I've seen the change. They used to rush through here, and it was wonderful to watch, it was the hurry of men who knew where they were going and were eager to get there. Now they're hurrying because they are afraid. It's not a purpose that drives them, it's fear. They're not going anywhere, they're escaping. And I don't think they know what it is they want to escape. They don't look to one another. They jerk when brushed against. They smile but it's an ugly kind of smiling: it's not joy, it's pleading. I don't know what it is that's happening to the world." He shrugged. "Oh well, who is John Galt?"

### Chapter 4 - The Immovable Movers

> On her way through the plant, she had seen an enormous piece of machinery left abandoned in a corner of the yard. It had been a precision machine tool once, long ago, of a kind that could not be bought anywhere now. It had not been worn out; it had been rotted by neglect, eaten by rust and the black drippings of a dirty oil. She had turned her face away from it. A sight of that nature always blinded her for an instant by the burst of too violent an anger. She did not know why; she could not define her own feeling; she knee only that there was, in her feeling, a scream of protest against injustice, and that it was in response to something much beyond an old piece of machinery. 

> Above the door of a shop, the black hole of a radio loudspeaker was hurling sounds at the streets. They were the sounds of a symphony concert being given somewhere in the city. They were a long screech without shape, as of cloth and flesh being torn at random. They scattered with no melody, no harmony, no rhythm to hold them. If music was emotion and emotion came from thought, then this was the scream of chaos, of the irrational, of the helpless, of man's self-abdication. 

> She wished they had not caught a picture of him when he smiled. That kind of smile did not belong in the pages of a newspaper. It was the smile of a man who is able to see, to know and to create the glory of existence. It was the mocking, challenging smile of a brilliant intelligence. 

> Dagny, the whole world's in a terrible state right now. I don't know what's wrong with it, but something's very wrong. Men have to get together and find a way out. But who's to decide which was to take unless it's the majority? I guess that's the only fair method of deciding, I don't see any other. K suppose somebody's got to be sacrificed. If it turned out to be me, I have no right to complain. The right's on their side. Men have to get together. 

If people can make you believe that the good you are doing is in fact bad, can get you to override your own judgement, your competence and belief in quality and what is good, then the world is truly in a dire situation. 

> Nothing can give them the right to turn men into sacrificial animals. Nothing can make it moral to destroy the best. One can't be punished for being good. 

This idea, of people being punished for doing good, exceedingly good, the mix of hatred, fear, terror, anxiety and contempt felt by incapable people towards capable people and the perverse satisfaction gained by subduing people, by dominating more capable people, is scary. It's the Cain and Abel story with a twist. It's as if instead of killing what's good, the bad is slowly poisoning it making it eventually fall prey to it, using it's drive to do good for it's own purpose to derive pleasure from the act of domination. Of finding ways to outdo competence in a fair competition, by making the competition unfair, winning by stacking the cards, and then making the other person believe that they were truly worse, that them losing, even though knowing that the others cheated, was good. That them trying is an error. 

> *This* was reality, she thought, this sende of clear outlines, of purpose, of lightness, if hope. This was the way she had expected to live—she had wanted to spend no hour and take no action that would mean less than this. 

> Whatever we are, it's we who move the world and it's we who pull it through. 

### Chapter 5 - The Climax of the D'Anconias

> The D'Anconia heirs had been men of unusual ability, but none of them could match what Francisco d'Anconia promised to become. It was as if the centuries had sifted the family's qualities through a fine mesh, had discarded the irrelevant, the inconsequential, the weak, and had let nothing through except pure talent; as if chance, for once had achieved an entity devoid of the accidental. 

> His attitude was not "I can do it better than you". But simply, "I can do it." What he meant by doing was doing superlatively. 

> Let's find out or Let's make it. These were his only form of enjoyment. 

> You ought to discover some day that words have an exact meaning. 

> "What's the most depraved type of human being?" "The man without a purpose."

> There is nothing of importance in life—except how well you do your work. Nothing. Only that. Whatever else you are will come from that. It's the only measure of human value. All the codes of ethics they'll try to ram down your throat are just so much paper money put out by swindlers to fleece people of their virtues. The code of competence is the only system of morality that's on a gold standard. 

The disappointment of somebody who doesn't understand how the world and the people in it can cherish being stupid. How not taking pride in ones abilities and the quest of making them better, of being excellent and knowing about it, of competing to see how far one can go, can exist as a valid attitude towards life, is too much to bear for people like Dagny Taggart. 

> She faced with astonished indignation the ugly fact of feeling pain, and refused to let it matter. Suffering was a senseless accident, it was not part of life as she saw it. 

> He had the vitality of a healthy human being, a thing so rare that no one could identify it. 

### Chapter 6 - The Non-commercial

> When a problem came up at the mills, his first concern was to discover what error he had made; he did not search for anyone's fault but his own; it was of himself that he demanded perfection. 

> The purpose of philosophy is not to help men find the meaning of life, but to prove to them that there isn't any. 

The constant tug between the people who want to abdicate all responsibility, deny that there is good and bad, and sloth around, not doing things except to destroy, to hinder and halter, to loot and the people watching, aghast, who want to be productive who think that work is a good thing, an expression of self, is building throughout the whole book. 

> It is this insistence of man upon meaning that makes him so difficult. Once he realizes that he is of no importance whatever in the vast scheme of the universe, that no possible significance can be attached to his activities, that it does not matter whether he lives or dies, he will become much more... tractable. 

> If people were forbidden to buy a million copies of the same piece of trash, they would be forced to buy better books. 

This sentence sums up the whole idea so crisply. If people want to force their standards of good onto other people, believing they can choose them better than the people themselves, hell breaks loose. And if they are going to take things from other based on their ideas of good and bad, hell becomes reality. Tyranny is the result. 

> Property rights are a superstition. One holds property only by the courtesy of those who do not seize it. The people can seize it at and moment. If they can, why shouldn't they?

> Your sister is a symptoms of the illness of our century. A decadent product of the machine age. Machines have destroyed man's humanity, taken him away from the soil, robbed him of his natural arts, killed his soul and turned him into an insensitive robot. 

### Chapter 7 - The Exploiters and the Exploited

> The men looked at her without curiosity. They did not seek astonished to see a woman in evening clothes enter a slum diner; nothing astonished anyone, these days. The owner turned impassively to fill her order; there was, in his stolid indifference, the kind of mercifulness that asks no questions. She could not tell whether the four at the counter were beggars or working men; neither the clothes nor manner showed the difference, these days. 

> Don't believe the dreams they pump you full of, and you won't get hurt. What dreams? The stories they tell you when you're young—about the human spirit. There isn't any human spirit. Man is just a low-grade animal without intellect, without soul without virtues or moral values. An animal with only two capacities: to eat and to reproduce. 

> He found the fountain of youth, which he wanted to bring down to men. Only he never came back. Why didn't he? Because h found that it couldn't be brought down. 

> She sat, watching him in the manner of a scientist: assuming nothing, discarding emotion, seeking only to observe and understand. 

> Well, that may be vicious, unjust, calamitous—but such is life in society. Somebody is always sacrificed, as a rule unjustly; there is no other way to live among men. What can any one person do?

> There is no other way to live on earth. Men are not open to truth or reason. They cannot be reached by a rational argument. The mind is powerless against them. Yet we have to deal with them. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to deceive them into letting us accomplish it. Or force them. They understand nothing else. We cannot expect their support for any endeavor of the intellect, for any goal of the spirit. They are nothing but vicious animals. They are greedy, self-indulgent predatory dollar chasers. 

> Intelligence? It is such a rare, precarious spark that flashes for a moment somewhere among men, and vanishes. One cannot tell its nature, or its future or its death. 

> That's your cruelty, that's what's mean and selfish about you. If you loved your brother, you'd give him a job he didn't deserve, precisely because he didn't deserve it—*that* would be true love and kindness and brotherhood. Else what's love for? If a man *deserves* a job, there's no virtue in giving it to him. Virtue is the giving of the undeserved. 

> He had never known fear because, against any disaster, he had held the omnipotent cure of being able to act. 

### Chapter 8 - The John Galt Line

> She felt an emotion held back for years: a loneliness much beyond this moment, beyond the silence of the room and the wet, glistening emptiness of the street, the loneliness of a gray wasteland where nothing was worth reaching; the loneliness of her childhood. 

> "There are no objective facts," he had said. "Every report on facts is only somebody's opinion. It is, therefore, useless to write about facts. 

> The reporters who came to the press conference in the office if the John Galt Line were young men who had been trained to think that their job consisted of concealing from the world the nature of its events. It was their daily duty to serve as audience for some public figure who made utterances about the public good, in phrases carefully chosen to convey no meaning. It was their daily job to sling words together in any combination they pleased, so long as the words did not fall into a sequence of saying something specific. 

> It was the security of being first, with full sight and full knowledge of one's course—not the blind sense of being pulled into the unknown by some unknown power ahead. It was the greatest sensation of existence: not to trust, but to know. 

> Why had she always felt that joyous sense of confidence when looking at machines?—she thought. In these giant shapes, two aspects pertaining to the inhuman were radiantly absent: the causeless and the purposeless. Every part of the motors was an embodied answer to "Why?" And "What for?"—like the steps of a life-couese chosen by the sort of mind she worshipped. The motors were a moral code cast in steel. They *are* alive, she thought, because they are the physical shape of the action of a living power—of the mind that had been able to grasp the whole of this complexity, to set its purpose, to give it form. 

### Chapter 9 - The Sacred and the Profane

> I mean, we're only human beings—and what's a human being? A weak, ugly, sinful creature, born that way, rotten in his bones—so humility I'd the one virtue he ought to practice. He ought to spend his life on his knees, begging to be forgiven his dirty existence. When a man thinks he's good—*that's* when he's rotten. Pride is the worst of all sins, no matter what he's done. 

> Unhappiness is the hallmark of virtue. If a man is unhappy, really, truly unhappy, it means that he is a superior sort of person. 

> The young man worked swiftly, competently, as if he enjoyed it. 

> Apparently, their idea of the height of glory is to deal with people who need them. 

> The empty structures were vertical rubble; they had been eaten, not by time, but by men: boards torn out at random, missing patches of roofs, holes left in gutted cellars. 

### Chapter 10 - Wyatt's Torch

> No principle ever filled anyone's milk bottle. The only thing that counts in life is solid, material assets. It's no time for theories, when everything is falling to pieces around us. 

> Helplessness was a strange experience, new to her; she had never found it hard to face things and make decisions; but she was not dealing with things—this was a fog without shapes or definitions, in which something kept forming and shifting before it could be seen, like semi-clots in a not-quite liquid. 

> What were the weapons if values were not a weapon any longer?

> Love, Miss. Taggart. That is the key to everything. If men learned to love one another, it would solve all their problems. 

> You're...  you're a philosopher... the greatest philosopher living... an immortal name... why would *you* do *this*? Because I am a philosopher, Miss Taggart. 

> And Taggart Transcontinental was not a living plant, fed by blood it had worked to produce, but a cannibal of that moment, devouring the unborn children of greatness. 

## Part Two - Either-Or

### Chapter 1 - The Man Who Belonged on Earth

> You see Dr. Stadler, people don't want to think. And the deeper they get into trouble, the less they want to think. But by some sort of instinct, they feel that they ought to and it makes them feel guilty. So they'll bless and follow anyone who gives them a justification for not thinking. Anyone who makes a virtue—a highly intellectual virtue—out of what they know to be their sin, their weakness and their guilt. 

> A desire presupposes the possibility of action to achieve it; action presupposes a goal which is worth achieving. If the only goal possible was to wheedle a precarious moment's favor from men who held guns, then neither action nor desire could exist any longer. Then could life?—he asked himself indifferently. Life, he thought, had been defined as motion; man's life was purposeful motion; what was the state of a being to whom purpose and motion where denied, a being held in chains but left to breathe and to see all the magnificence of the possibilities he could have reached, left to scream "Why?" and to be shown the muzzle of a gun as sole explanation?

### Chapter 2 - The Aristocracy of Pull

> Now, the possibility of being sent to jail—if this dinner was a felony—meant no more to him than the possibility of being run over by a truck: an ugly physical accident without any moral significance. 

> Everyone agrees that anything you do is good, so long as it's not for yourself... But she won't give me credit for a good purpose. She doesn't think anybody's good except herself. My sister is a ruthless, conceited bitch, who won't take anyone's ideas but her own... Why do they keep looking at me that way—she and Rearden and all those people? Why are they so sure they're right?... If I acknowledge their superiority in the material realm, why don't they acknowledge mine in the spiritual?

> My way of trading is to know that the joy that you give me is paid for by the joy you get from me—not by your suffering or mine. I don't accept sacrifices and I don't make them. If you asked me for more that you meant to me, I would refuse. If you asked me to give up the railroad, I'd leave you. If ever the pleasure of one has to be bought by the pain of the other, there better be no trade at all. A trade by which one gains and the other loses is a fraud. You don't do it in business, Hank. Don't do it in your own life. 

# TODO: Add Francisco d'anconia speech complete

> Times change and people change with the times. The wise ones do. Wisdom lies in knowing when to remember and when to forget. Consistency is not a habit of mind which it is wise to practice or to expect of the human race. 

> If you want to see an abstract principle, such as moral action, in material form—there it is. Look at it, Mr. Rearden. Every girder of it, every pipe, wire and valve was put there by a choice in answer to the question: right or wrong? You had to choose right and you had to choose the best within your knowledge—the best for your purpose, which was to make steel—and then move on and extend the knowledge, and do better, and still better, with your own purpose as your standard of value. You had to act on your own judgement, you had to have the capacity to judge, the courage to stand on the verdict of your mind, and the purest, the most ruthless consecration to the rule of doing right, of doing the best, the utmost best possible to you. Nothing could have made you act against your judgement, and you would have rejected as wrong—evil—any man who attempted to tell you that the best way to heat a furnace was to fill it with ice. Millions of men, an entire nation, were not able to deter you from producing Rearden Metal—because you had the knowledge of its Superlative value and the power which such knowledge gives. But what I wonder about, Mr. Rearden, is why you live by one code of principles when you deal with nature and by another when you deal with men?


# TODO: Add Francisco Speech to Rearden


> To the rhythm of his his body, with the scorching heat on his face and the winter night on his shoulder blades, he was seeing suddenly that this was the simple essence of his universe: the instantaneous refusal to submit to disaster, the irresistible drive to fight it, the triumphant feeling of his own ability to win. 

### Chapter 4 - The Sanction of the Victim 

> It's the most insufferable form of vanity, this insistence on always doing right. How do you know what's right? How can anyone ever know it? It's nothing but a delusion to flatter your own ego and to hurt other people by flaunting your superiority over them. 

> I think you should abandon the illusion of your own perfection, which you know full well to be an illusion. I think you should learn to get along with other people. The day of the hero us past. This is the day of humanity, in a much deeper sense than you imagine. Human beings are no longer expected to be saints nor to be punished for their sins. Nobody is right or wrong, we're all in it together, we're all human—and the human is the imperfect. 

> She wanted to force upon him the suffering of dishonor—but his own sense of honor was her only weapon of enforcement. She wanted to wrest from him an acknowledgement of his moral depravity—but only his own moral rectitude could attach significance to such a verdict. She wanted to injury him by her contempt—but he could not be injured, unless he respected her judgement.she wanted to punish him for the spin he had caused her and she held her pain as a gun aimed at him, as if she wished to extort his agony at the point of his pity. But her only took was his own benevolence, his concern for her, his compassion. Her only power was the power of his own virtues. What if he chose to withdraw it?

> They looked at him without admiration—admiration was a feeling they had lost the capacity to experience, long ago; they looked with curiosity and with a dim sense of defiance against those who had told them that it was their duty to hate him.

> A prisoner brought to trial can defend himself only if there is an objective principle of justice recognized by his judges, a principle upholding his rights, which they may not violate and which he can invoke. The law, by which you are trying me, holds that there are no principles, that I have no rights and that you may do with me whatever you please. Very well. Do it. 

> Who is the public? What does it hold as its good? There was a time when men believed that "the good" was a concept to be defined by a code of moral values and that no man had the right to seek his food through the violation of the rights of another. If it is no believed that my fellow men max sacrifice me in any manner they please for the sake of whatever they deem to be their own good, if they believe that they may seize my property simply because they need it—well, so does any burglar. There is only this difference: the burglar does not ask me to sanction his act. 

> If this is what has beaten us, the guilt is ours. 

> The man who despises himself tries to gain self-esteem from sexual adventures—which can't be done, because sex is not the cause, but an effect and an expression of a man's sense of his own value. 

> The men who think that weatlh comes from material resources and has no intellectual root or meaning, are the men who think—for the same reason—that sex is a physical capacity which functions independently of one's mind, choice or code of values. They think that your body creates a desire and makes a choice for you just about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into railroad rails of its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man's sexual choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what a man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.

### Chapter 5 - Account Overdrawn

> There was no wood to burn, no metal to make new stoves, no tools to pierce the walls of the houses for new installations. In makeshift contraptions of bricks and oil cans, professors were burning the books of their libraries, and fruit-growers were burning the trees of their orchards. "Privations strengthen a people's spirit," wrote Bertram Scudder, "and forge the fine steel of social discipline. Sacrifice is the cement which unites human bricks into the great edifice of society."

> A city is the frozen shape of human courage—the courage of those men who thought for the first time if every bolt, rivet and power generator that went to make it. The courage to say, not "It seems to me," but "*It is*"—and to stake one's life on one's judgement. 

> John Galt is Prometheus who changed his mind. After centuries of being torn by vultures in payment for having brought to men the fire of the gods, he broke his chains—and he withdrew his fire until the day when men withdraw their vultures. 

> He saw the look of a peculiar panic growing in her eyes: it was not the look of understanding, but of a ferocious refusal to understand—as if she wanted to turn the violence of her emotion into s fog screen, as if she hoped, not that it would blind her to reality, but that her blindness would make reality cease to exist. 

### Chapter 6 - Miracle Metal

> We've got to run the world for the sake of the little people. It's intelligence that's caused all the troubles of humanity. Man's mind is the root of all evil. This is the day of the heart. It's the weak, the meek, the sick and the humble that mus be the only objects of our concern. His lower lip was twisting in soft, lecherous motions. Those who are big are here to serve those who aren't. If they refuse to do their moral duty, we've got to force them. There once was an Age of Reason, but we've progressed beyond it. This is the Age of Love. 

> Genius is a superstition. There's no such thing as the intellect. A man's brain is a social product. A sum of influences that he's picked up from those around him. Nobody invents anything, he merely reflects what's floating in the social atmosphere. A genius is an intellectual scavenger and a greedy hoarder of the ideas which rightfully belong to society, from which he stole them. All thought I'd theft. If we do away with private fortunes, well have a fairer distribution of wealth. If we do away with genius, we'll have a fairer distribution of ideas. 

> If there's not enough guilt in the world, we must create it. If we teach a man that it's evil to look at spring flowers and he believes us and then does it—we'll be able to do whatever we please with him. He won't defend himself. He won't feel he's worth it. He won't fight. But save us from the man who lives up to his own standards. Save us from the man of clean conscience. He's the man who'll beat us. 

> The exhaustion was gone by the time she stepped back into the office. No matter what night preceded it, she had never known a morning where she did not feel the rise of a quiet excitement that became a tightening energy in her body and a hunger for action in her mind—because this was the beginning of a day and it was a day of *her* life. 

> If I had not known that my life depends on my mind and my effort, if I had not ksrebit mx highest moral purpose to exercise the best of my effort and the fullest capacity of my mind in order to support and expand my life, you would have found nothing to loot from me, nothing to support your own existence: It is not my sins that you're using to injure me, but my virtues—my virtues by your own acknowledgement, since your life depends on them, since you need them, since you do not seek to destroy my achievement but to seize it.

### Chapter 7 - The Moratorium on Brains

> Freedom, do let's stop talking of freedom. Freedom is impossible. Man can never be free of hunger, of cold, of disease, physical accidents. He can never be free of the tynarry of nature. So why should he object to the tyranny of a political dictatorship?

> He knew that she a court is not bound by any rules, it is not bound by any facts, and then a hearing is not an issue of justice, but an issue of men, and your ate depends not on what you have or haven not done, but on whom you do or do not know. 

### Chapter 8 - By Our Love

### Chapter 9 - The Face without Pain or Fear

### Chapter 10 - The Sign of the Dollar

> What was it they'd always told us about the vicious competition of the profit system, where men had to compete for who'd do a better job than his fellows? Vicious wasn't it? Well they should have seen what it was like when we all had to compete with one another for who'd do the worst job possible. There's no surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at *not* doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. 

> But when I hear them repeating that question, I feel afraid. I think of the man who said he would stop the motor of the world. You see, his name was John Galt. 

> It was the only country in history where wealth was not acquired by looting but by production, not by force, but by trade, the only country whose money was the symbol of man's right to his own mind, to his work, to his life, to his happiness, to himself. If this is evil, by the present standards of the world, if this is the reason for damning us, them we—we, the dollar chasers and makers—accept it and choose to be damned by that world. We choose to wear the sign of the dollar on our foreheads, proudly, as our badge of nobility—the badge we are willing to live for and, if need be, to die. 

## Part Three - A is A

### Chapter 1 - Atlantis

> John Galt found the fountain of youth which he wanted to bring down to men. Only he never came back... Because he found that it couldn't be brought down. 

> Any man who's afraid of hiring the best ability he can find, is a cheat who's in a business where he doesn't belong. To me—the foulest man on earth, more contemptible than a criminal, is the employer who rejects men for being too god. 

> Her consciousness surrendered to a single sight and a single, wordless emotion—but she had always known that an emotion was a sum totaled by an adding machine of the mind, and what she now felt was the instantaneous total of the thoughts she did not have to name, the final sum of a long progression like a voice telling her by means of a feeling: If she had held onto Quentin Daniels, with no hope of a chance to use the motor, for the sole sake of knowing that achievement had not died on earth—if like a a weighted diver sinking in an ocean of mediocrity, under the pressure of men with gelatin eyes, rubber voices, spiral-shaped convictions, non-committal souls and non-commiting hands, she had held, as her life line and oxygen tube, the thought of a superlative achievement of the human mind—if, at the sight of the motor's remnant, in a sudden gasp of suffocation, as a last protest from his corruption-eaten lungs, Dr. Stadler had cried for something, not to look down at, but up to, and *this* had been the cry, the longing and the fuel of her life—if she had moved, drawn by the hunger of her youth for a sight of clean, hard, radiant competence—then here it was before her, reached and done, the power of an incomparable mind given shape in a net of wires sparkling peacefully under a summer sky, drawing an incalculable power out of space into the secret interior of a small stone hovel. 

> She knew that there was no meaning in motors or factories or trains, that their only meaning was in men's enjoyment of his life, which they served. 

> The work of achieving ones happiness was the purpose, the sanction and the meaning of life. 

> I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man nor ask another man to live for mine. 

> No justice has not ceased to exist. How could it? It is possible for men to abandon their sight of it, and then it is justice that destroys them. But it is not possible for justice to go out of existence because one is an attribute of the other because justice is the act of acknowledging that which exists. 

> What us wrong with a philosopher running a roadside diner? Or a cigarette factory? All work is an act of philosophy. And when men will learn to consider productive work—and that which is its source—as the standard of their moral values, they will reach that stage of perfection which is the birthright they lost... The source of work? Man's mind. Man's reasoning mind. 

> Stagnation is not man's fate, impotence is not his nature, the ingenuity of his mind is his noblest and most joyous power. 

# TODO: Add John Galts speech (page 678.)

> I saw the impertinent malice of mediocrity boastfully holding up its own emptiness as an abyss to be filled by the bodies of its betters. 

> They say it's hard for men to agree. You'd be surprised how easy if is—when both parties hold as their moral absolute that neither exists for the sake of the other and that reason is their only means of trade. 

### Chapter 2 - The Utopia of Greed

> We do not hold the belief that this earth us a realm of misery where man is doomed to destruction. We do not think that tragedy is our natural fate and we do not live in chronic dread of disaster. We do not expect disaster until we have specific reason to expect it—and when we encounter it, we are free to fight it. It is not happiness, but suffering that we consider unnatural. It is not success, but calamity that we regard as the abnormal exception in human life. 

> She lay half stretched in an armchair of the living room, crumpled by that heavy, indifferent lassitude which is not the will to laziness, but the frustration of the will to a secret violence that had no lesser action can satisfy. 

> It does take an exceptional mind and a still more exceptional integrity to remain untouched by the brain-destroying influences of the world's doctrines, the accumulated evil of centuries. 

> Every man builds his world in his own image. He has the power to choose but not the power to escape the necessity of choice. If he abdicates his power, he abdicates the status of man, and the grinding chaos of the irrational is what he achieves as his sphere of existence—by his own choice. 

> There is no conflict, and no call for sacrifice, and no man is a threat to the aims of another—if men understand that reality is an absolute not to be faked, that lies do not work, that the unearned cannot be had, that the undeserved cannot be given, that the destruction of a value which *is*, will not bring value to that which isn't. 

> I cannot bring myself to abandon to destruction all the greatness of the world, all that which was mine and yours, which was made by us and is still ours by right—becsuse I cannot believe that men can refuse to see, that they can remain blind and deaf to us forever, when the truth is ours and their lives depend ob accepting it. They still love their lives—and *that* is the uncorrupted remnant of their minds. So long as men desire to live, I cannot lose my battle. 

### Chapter 3 - Anti Greed

> Questions of truth do not enter into social issues. Principles have no influence on public affairs. Reason has no power over human beings. Logic is impotent. Morality is superfluous. 

> I love you. As the same value, as the same expression, with the same pride and the same meaning as I love my work, my mills, my Metal, my hours at a desk, at a furnace, in a laboratory, in an ore mine, as I love my ability to work, as I love the act of sight and knowledge, as I love the action of my mind when it solves a chemical equation or grasps a sunrise, as I love the things I've made and the things I've felt, as *my* product, *my* choice, as a shape of my world, as my best mirror, as the wife I've never had, as that which makes all the rest of it possible: as my power to live. 

> People think that a liar gains a victory over his victim. What I've learned is that a lie is an act of self-abdication, because one surrenders one's reality to the person to whom one lies, making that person ones master condemning oneself from then on to faking the sort of reality that person's view requires to be faked. 

> There are no white lies, there is only the blackness of destruction, and a white lie is the blackest of all. 

### Chapter 4 - Anti-Life

> All of you welfare preachers —it'd not unearned money that you're after. You want handouts but of a different kind. I'm a gold-digger of the spirit, you said, because I look for value. Then you, the welfare preachers... it's the spirit that you want to loot. I never thought and nobody ever told us how it could be thought of and what it would mean—the unearned in spirit. But that is what you want. You want unearned love. You want unearned admiration. You want unearned greatness. You want to be a man like Hank Rearden without fhd necessity of being what he is. Without the necessity of being anything. Without... the necessity... of being. 

> Those who grant sympathy to guilt, grant none to innocence. 

> An animal knows who are its friends and who are its enemies, and when to defend itself. It doesn't expect a friend to step on it or to cut its throat. It doesn't expect to be told that love is blind, that plunder is achievement, that gangsters are statesmen, and that it's great to break the spine of Hank Rearden. 

### Chapter 5 - Their Brother's Keepers

> These were men whom official speeches described as "the progressive businessman of our dynamic age", but whom people called "the pull peddlers"—the species included many breeds, those of "transportation pull", and of "steel pull" and "oil pull" and "wage-raising pull" and "suspended sententence pull"—men who *were* dynamic, who kept darting all over the country while no one else could move, men who were active and mindless, active, not like animals, but like that which breeds, feeds and moves upon the stillness of a corpse. 

> There was a time, she thought, when his mind, his energy, his inexhaustible resourcefulness had been given to the task of a producer devising better ways to deal with nature; *now*, they were switched to the task of a criminal outwitting men. She wondered how long a man could endure a change of that kind. 

> Joy is the goal of existence. And joy is not to be stumbled upon, but achieved, and the act of treason is to let its vision drown in the swamp of the moment's torture. 

### Chapter 6 - The Concerto of Deliverance

> He thought of all the living species that train their young in the art of survival, the cats who teach their kittens to hunt, the birds who spend such strident effort on teaching their fledglings to fly—yet man, whose tool of survival is the mind, does not merely fail to teach a child to think, but devotes the child's education to the purpose of destroying his brain, of convincing him that thought is futile and evil before he has started to think. 

### Chapter 7 - "This is John Galt speaking"

> She went on protected from the world around her by a last armor: indifference. 

> People read the newspapers and acted as if they believed what they read, each competing with the others on who would keep most blindly silent, each pretending that he did not know what he knew, each striving to believe that the unnamed wat the unreal. It was as if a volcano were cracking open, yet the people at the foot of the mountain ignored the sudden fissures, the black fumes, the boiling trickles, and went on believing that their only danger was to acknowledge the reality of these signs.

### Chapter 10 - In the Name of the Best Within Us

> The music of Richard Halley's Fifth Concerto streamed from his keyboard, past the glass of the window, and spread through the air, over the lights of the valley. It was a symphony of triumph. The notes flowed up, they spoke of rising and they were the rising itself, they erre the essence and the form of upward motion, they seemed to embody every human act and thought that had ascent as its motive. It was a sunburst of sound, breaking out of hiding and spreading open. It had the freedom of release and the tension of purpose. It swept space clean and left nothing but the joy of an unobstructed effort. Only a faint echo within the sounds spoke of that from which the music had escaped, but spoke in laughing astonishment at the discovery that there was no ugliness or pain and there never had to be. It was the song of an immense deliverance.
