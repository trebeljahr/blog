excerpt: "The core thesis of the book is that consciousness can not be understood scientifically. Instead Thomas Nagel thinks that consciousness has to be a fundamental, somewhat inexplicable part of the universe. Just like energy or information are. And this proto-consciousness is something that is endowed onto anything within the universe, something that explains, why our lives are filled with precepts and moral notions."

## Summary

<p>{excerpt}</p>

To me, the most interesting part of the book is his constant attack on science and how it will be incapable of explaining the nature of consciousness. Because he thinks that consciousness is something irreducible, something that can't be explained the same way we explain other facets of the universe. 

This thought is powerful, thinking that there are things, that there is a possibility that there are things that will be forever beyond the grasp of our scientific understanding. 

## Detailed Notes

### Chapter 0 - Introduction

The existence of minds, coming from physics is not well explained by current scientific method. Hence a new system of thinking has to be brought forth. 

> If physics and chemistry cannot fully account for life and consciousness, how will their immense body of truth be combined with other elements in an expanded conception of the natural order that can accommodate those things?

Probability is too high stacked against science to let it explain evolution and the origin of life. Hence they can't explain it.

Intelligent Design Argument should be taken more seriously as an hypothesis. Basically saying, reality has a mechanism, beyond evolution and selection that makes meaning synthesizing, teleological machinery like cells more likely than one would expect on the grounds of chemistry alone. (Isn't this just a better method of explanation though? Still reductionist scientifically?)

### Chapter 1 - Antireductionisum and the Natural Order

Reductionism is necessary to explain mind in terms of physical things. Mind is fundamentally different somehow, and to explain it materialistically means that it is necessary to reduce it to atoms and physics somehow. But the task of how is so tricky and convoluted that it suggests that it isn't possible and that mind is *different* somehow from matter. 

> Mind not just an afterthought or an accident or an add-on, but a basic aspect of nature. 

> The intelligibility of the world is no accident. Mind, in this view is doubly related to the natural order. Nature is such as to give rise to conscious beings with minds; and it is such as to be comprehensible to such beings. 

**Ideas:** Isn't it that minds arise because they comprehend the world? Meaning that if there are minds they also comprehend the world, they have to otherwise they would be evolutionarily useless. 

**Idea:** What he suggests is that the bridging between life and physics has to happen, it is inscribed into the nature of the world itself... But isn't that pushing the problem back? I.e. if this nature is to be understood, ever, wouldn't that mean that these ideas would become part of physics, but the scop of physics would drastically increase and change?

When reaching the bottom of physics we assume that these things are that way and kind of stop asking why... Fundamental laws of physics are taken on assumption, we don't know their "why's". Nagel is suggesting that we similarly have to stop at a higher level of abstraction, that of emergence and accept emergence, of intelligence and of life, as fundamental to the universe. Just as fundamental as physical laws, as another physical law then? 

I think there is a misrepresentation there, scientific reductionism thinks there is *no* stopping point. The physical laws are not sacred, even they are reducible. Science wants good explanations and as little of them as possible. Axioms and "do not go further" signs are not good explanations. They can very often be reduced and derived from simpler truths. If people for hundreds of years would make no progress on the problems of emergence of mind and life, then sure, but they do all the time, showing that it might be in fact a reducible problem. Because every problem is irreducible until it's proven otherwise by example. 

The problem is really that scientists (or people in general) have a problem with being told they can't understand or do something, and a track record to show you that they actually *can* understand and do, often better than you would have ever imagined. 

> All explanations come to an end somewhere. 

Scientists keep searching to push that end further back.

Isn't it good that we should doubt our senses? Because the worldview that we form, with evolutionary aspects at its basis is not 100% true, because there is no such thing as "absolute" truths only degrees of confidence?

### Chapter 3 - Consciousness

**Book Recommendation:** The Concept of Mind – Gilbert Ryle

**Book Recommendation:** Philosophical I vestigations – Ludwig Wittgenstein

The Problem of Consciousness is qualia - subjective experiences, the "how it feels to experience something". Would a set of connected wires also *feel* in the same way that we do, if it is wired up correctly? Why and how? => This is the hard problem of consciousness.

**Book Recommendation:** Naming and Necessity – Saul Kripke

> Conscious subjects and their mental lives are inescapable components of reality not describable by the physical sciences. 

**Book Recommendation:** Mental Events and the Brain – Paul Feyerabend

**Book Recommendation:** Concealment and Exposure, and other Essays – Thomas Nagel

When trying to understand consciousness it forces one to rethink the whole world, if it is not reducible to atoms. The whole argument of the whole book rests on this one assumption, that consciousness is something that can't be explained by physics. Ever. No matter how advanced the physics. This is pretty bonkers, because whatever model he proposes as an explanation, *that* is also physics if he were to formulate it completely. If there is something that makes it so that the universe has to have life, conscious life, well then, describe it mathematically how and why that is the case and you are back to a physical description. That describes the consciousness field or whatnot. 

Factual accounts of what happened are not explanations. Explanations need more, they need to connect the facts into a picture that makes sense. They need to provide a why, a reasoning for why the events happened in *this* way and not another. 

**Book Recommendation:** The Demon Haunted World – Carl Sagan

To me this whole idea if "but why do they have minds that work this way" idea makes no sense. Minds are an incredibly useful tool for survival because they allow for real time decision making according to a few genetically controlled inputs... It's like asking: "but why exactly does a snake have venom that works this way? It doesn't make sense, the snake should have no venom, it could hunt its prey without it." True for sure, but the snake that has venom outcompetes that without, and that's exactly the kind of ratchet that leads to evolution giving snakes venom. So answering the question, why are there venomous snakes is the same as answering why are there conscious beings? Because it is useful to have consciousness and venom. It's like asking "why are there watches?" 

> Any explanation [of consciousness] will have two elements: an ahistorical constitutive account of how certain complex physical systems are also mental, and a historical account of how such systems arose in the universe from it's beginnings. 

This to me makes no sense, he is saying that certain complex physical structures can be conscious, can be minds, but then in the next sentence also says that physical systems can't, if they don't have "minds" somehow built in already. Proposing that therefore everything needs mind from the beginning of the universe. 

To me the explanation, at least in it's outlines, for how complex systems can be conscious already exists. Information can be put into different kinds of systems, it can be acted upon and manipulated with yet other systems, allowing for abstract representation of concepts and computation. Computation is one level removed from material instantiation. Whether I put it in silicon or run it with a bunch of people waving flags around or have water trickling down through valves, the state representation and manipulation is the important part and it will consist of logic gates in all these instances, the blueprints and materials used will be different, but there is a deep analogy running between all of them, that of computation and information manipulation and storage. Consciousness is to information systems as information systems are to their physical manifestation. If systems process similar information in similar kinds of ways, they will be conscious in the same way. But since different things process different kinds of information their consciousness will differ, drastically. Now why this is necessary to arrive in the world, well again, these kinds of systems are really useful. Manipulation of data is useful, because it can provide insights, managing the systems that can do this, and the ability of adjusting them, leads, directly to consciousness. 

> All the elements of the physical world are also mental. 

I would say the thing that makes something mental is the degree to which it can be used to represent information. If it can be used to represent and manipulate information, then it can be used as a building block for things that are mental. But the crux is still that these elements have to be arranged into bigger wholes because otherwise they can't represent enough information to have enough complexity to be conscious. Hence the arrangement, the pattern is what's important, not the physical character of the things themselves. Otherwise it would be the same thing as saying that because certain atoms can build humans, those atoms share a bit of "humanness". And "birdness", and "stoneness" and every other thing that could be constituted from these atoms. This is obvious garbage, because then each atom has to contain a significant fraction of the entirety of the universe... This to me seems like the greater mystery, without explanation, rather than consciousness...

The irreducible thing might be the process of emergence. Why does, sometimes 1 + 1 = 42 

How do you find the part that make up a wave in water? It's the same problem that he is asking when trying to find the parts that make up the whole mind. The mind *is* the pattern, just as the wave is non-existent physically, or the crane in the origami is non-existent physically, it's the relation between pieces of matter to each other that is important, not the matter itself. I.e. and Origami Crane made out of different paper is very alike another, even though both consist of entirely different atoms. And so are we, a wave of atoms, a pattern, persisting through time, but the pattern is that of a mind, attached to and part of a human body.

> We should seek a form of understanding that enables us to see ourselves and other conscious organisms as specific expressions simultaneously of the physical and the mental character of the universe. 

### Chapter 4 - Cognition

> There are norms of thought which, if we follow them, will tend to lead us toward the correct answers to those questions. 

> To acquire a language is in part to acquire a system of concepts that enables us to understand reality. 

Does evolution produce systems that can think generally - that can abstract away over their sensory data and derive truths outside of it? 
If so, how?

How can subject independence exist, and how can we learn that?

> Complex scientific theories [...] are extensions of the highly adaptive capacity to learn from experience—our own and that of others. 

**Book Recommendation:** Unto Others – David Sloan Wilson

We can discover moral rules by extending from our own wants and needs, generalizing them to other minds that we assume to be working just as ours using our capacity for theory of mind. 

> The distinctive thing about reason is that it connects us with the truth directly. 

This directly is because our brains are computational machines. When we reason we do inference computations in our brains. And these computations are more or less directly manipulating information by changing the state of our neural networks of synapses and neuron firing activation patterns. 

Contradictions don't exist easily because a brain trained on pattern matching can't make two patterns it matched be equal to each other. The patterns are distinct, even if they are abstract patterns of reasoning, hence they are incompatible. 

> Rational creatures can step back from [...] influences and try to make up their own minds. 

> Each of our lives is a part of the lengthy process of the universe gradually waking up and becoming aware of itself. 

The protomental elements he is suggesting is just atoms. Atoms if arranged in the right shapes can store information. And process it, i.e. do computation. This is enough for the rest to emerge. If there is anything remotely like matter and it can be there or not there, i.e. moved around then it can be arranged into patterns and these patterns assigned meaning according to some rules to represent other states of matter elsewhere. This is fundamentally what all of life and cognition does. Arrange matter in one place to capture some essence of information, often about the arrangement of matter in another place.

### Chapter 5 - Value

**Book Recommendation:** What We Owe to Each Other – T. M. Scanlon

> In every area of thought we must ultimately rely on ou judgement, tested by reflection, subject to correction by the counterarguments of others, modified by the imagination and by comparison with alternatives. 

He thinks that Moral Theory + Darwinian Account of Evolution can't be recombined and that one has to be false. For him that has to be the Account of Evolution. Morals are absolute truths outside of physics that can be discovered independently of the life that has evolved or hasn't evolved in his opinion. Therefore Darwinian Evolution has to be flawed. 

When a person gives another person who has a headache an aspirin this is because they recognize that pain is bad and that headaches cause pain and that aspirin makes the pain go away, and since pain is a fundamentally bad thing they recognize this fact and take the action - giving the aspirin. I think this example is flawed. People might not give the aspirin if they don't like the person. Or if they have somebody else that needs the aspirin. Or if they could sell it for something that they want. What is truly going on is that the person recognized a social situation where they can make a favor that increases their own chances of survival and this is due to being hard and softwired to do so. Both learning + genetics tell this to be the correct action in the right circumstances it's not the recognition of the other person's pain that would go away. Heck many things we think of as "good" in the social realm don't even offer these aspects of "pain"/"pleasure" such as gifting somebody flowers for their birthday or putting on nice clothes when going to a dinner. Where is the "good" in those actions to be found? I think it's "just" an adapted response to the social environments we find ourselves living in and optimizing for.

### Conclusion

Even though he doesn't have enough imagination to think of a theory that embeds teleological reasons into the fundamental picture of how the universe works, he is convinced that it is necessary to have, because he can't see how evolution can explain consciousness and objective values and truths.
